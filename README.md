🌟 Hi, I'm Riwas Karki! 🌟
👨‍💻 Data Scientist | 📊 Data Analyst | 🌱 Tech Enthusiast

I'm a recent Bachelor of IT graduate with a passion for turning data into insights. With experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and a toolkit full of libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I'm all about making data work for people! From building interactive data visualizations to creating end-to-end ETL pipelines, I love projects that combine creativity with analytics. I also enjoy collaborating on GitHub—let’s turn code into impact!

In my spare time, you'll find me playing football, diving into table tennis, or chilling with some great tunes. 🎶
